You're looking to create a compelling README for your Go project, "Ciplock," to impress recruiters. This project appears to be an authentication and project management API built with Gin Gonic, featuring admin and customer authentication flows.

Here's a well-structured and engaging README that highlights the key aspects of your project:

Ciplock: Secure & Scalable API Authentication
Unlocking Robust User & Project Management
Ciplock is a powerful and flexible API designed to provide secure authentication and streamlined project management. Built with Go and the Gin Gonic framework, Ciplock offers a robust backend solution for managing administrative users, their projects, and even customer-level authentication for those projects. This project demonstrates best practices in API development, including secure password handling, JWT-based authentication, and a clear, modular architecture.

üåü Features
Admin Authentication: Secure signup and login for administrative users.
Project Management: Admins can create and manage multiple projects, each with its unique API key.
Customer Authentication per Project: Enables external applications or services to onboard and authenticate their own users, tied specifically to a given project.
JWT-Based Authorization: Secure API access control using JSON Web Tokens.
Password Hashing: Implements bcrypt for strong password security.
Modular Design: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated packages for database interactions, middleware, models, and utilities.
Scalable Architecture: Built on Gin Gonic for high performance and easy extensibility.
üöÄ Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Go: Version 1.16 or higher.
PostgreSQL: Ciplock uses PostgreSQL as its database. Make sure you have it installed and a database created.
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Ciplock
Set up your database:
Create a PostgreSQL database and update your connection string in a configuration file (e.g., cliplockdb/db.go or an environment variable). You'll need to define your database schema based on the models package (e.g., admins, projects, customers tables).

Install dependencies:

Bash

go mod tidy
Run the application:

Bash

go run main.go
The server will start on http://localhost:8080.

üí° API Endpoints
Ciplock provides a clear set of RESTful API endpoints:

Public Endpoints
POST /signup: Register a new admin user.
POST /login: Authenticate an admin user and receive a JWT.
POST /auth/signup/:project_id: Register a new customer for a specific project.
POST /auth/login/:project_id: Authenticate a customer for a specific project and receive a JWT.
Authenticated Endpoints (Requires Admin JWT)
POST /addproject: Create a new project, generating a unique API key.
GET /projects: Retrieve all projects associated with the authenticated admin.
üõ†Ô∏è Built With
Go: The core language for the application.
Gin Gonic: A high-performance HTTP web framework for Go.
GORM: (Assumed, based on typical Go database interactions) An excellent ORM library for Go.
Bcrypt: For secure password hashing.
JWT (github.com/golang-jwt/jwt): For generating and validating secure tokens.
UUID (github.com/google/uuid): For generating unique identifiers.
